<BODY>
jTrust is a Java library for trust validation of X509 certificates. The
jTrust library features OCSP and CRL revocation checking, automatic CRL
fall-back when OCSP fails, CRL caching, and a clean architecture that is
ready for a scalable trust service implementation. A {@link
be.fedict.trust.TrustValidator} especially tweaked for validating
Belgian eID certificates can be created via the {@link
be.fedict.trust.BelgianTrustValidatorFactory} factory.
